## General info
CSA needs a web tool (API type) combining the telemetry data and images collected during the stratospheric balloon flight making them easy and intuitive to view/consult for scientists, the general public, kids, etc. This is a GUI that requires no tutorial and is easy to use for all age ranges, it has a backend that quickly cleans up and organizes data for display and it is an aesthetic environment that is pleasent to work in & contributes to the user's understanding. The API can easily be customized to fit the needs of higher and lower level users (e.g. scientists vs children), the users are able to open the program at any time and view real time photos, maps and graphs and despite the magnitude of the information, it is conveyed simple.

The live information currently embedded in our dashboard is the 2D coordinates (x,y) for GPS tracking, NADIR images, HORIZON images, Time (hour am/pm and dd/mm/yy), and Altitude (z).
 
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
